ScrollToTop is a React component that scrolls to the top of a page when the current location gets changed. Since React Router doesn't provide out-of-the-box support for scroll restoration due to [browsers having started handling it on their own](https://majido.github.io/scroll-restoration-proposal/history-based-api.html), this package implements a component for scrolling to the top manually as it is given in [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/scroll-restoration#scroll-restoration-scroll-to-top).

## Usage

```shell
npm install react-router-scroll-to-top
```

```jsx
import { ScrollToTop } from 'react-router-scroll-to-top';

const App = () => (
  <BrowserRouter>
    <ScrollToTop />
    <Switch>{/* routes */}</Switch>
  </BrowserRouter>
);
```

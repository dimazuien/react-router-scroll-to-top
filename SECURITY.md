## Reporting Security Issues

We take the security of the project seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by email directly to [the main project maintainer](mailto:dimazuien@gmail.com)

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Description of the issue
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

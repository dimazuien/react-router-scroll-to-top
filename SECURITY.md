# Reporting Security Issues

The security of the project is taken seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, **please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by email directly to [the project maintainer](mailto:dimazuien@gmail.com)

Please include information listed below (as much as you can provide) to give a better understanding of the nature and scope of the possible issue:

- Description of the issue
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help to triage your report more quickly.
